## Installation

[`@sumup/intl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/intl) needs to be installed as a dependency via the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package managers. The npm CLI ships with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). You can read how to install the Yarn CLI in [their documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). `@sumup/intl` requires Node v10+.

Depending on your preference, run one of the following:

```sh
# With Yarn
$ yarn add @sumup/intl

# With npm
$ npm install @sumup/intl
```

`@sumup/intl` wraps the [ECMAScript Internationalization API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) which is [supported by all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#search=NumberFormat) (note that [_formatToParts_](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-javascript_builtins_intl_numberformat_formattoparts) is not supported by IE11). If you need to support older browsers, you need to include [a polyfill for the `Intl.NumberFormat` API](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-numberformat).

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) supports the `Intl` API since v8, however, it includes only the English localizations up to v12. Node v13 and above support all locales. If you're unable to use Node v13+, you can either include [a polyfill for the `Intl.NumberFormat` API](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-numberformat) or use a [custom Node build](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/intl.html#intl_options_for_building_node_js).

## Usage

All functions exported by `@sumup/intl` share a similar interface such as the common [`locales`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl#locales_argument), [`options`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl#options_argument), and [`currency`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) arguments. These are passed on almost unchanged to the [`Intl.NumberFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat) constructor and thus support the same values. If the `locales` argument is not provided or is undefined, the runtime's default locale is used. Please refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) for more details.
