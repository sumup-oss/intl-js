## Introduction

`@sumup/intl` is a light abstraction layer on top of the [ECMAScript Internationalization API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl). In addition to a simplified API, it offers the following benefits:

### Performance

Creating instances of `Intl.*` formatters is an [expensive operation](https://blog.david-reess.de/posts/hBEx9w-on-number-formatting-and-performance). `@sumup/intl` solves this by [memoizing](https://github.com/formatjs/intl-format-cache) the `Intl` formatters with a cache key based on the arguments passed to the constructor.

### Compatibility

`@sumup/intl` works in [modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_intl_numberformat_numberformat,mdn-javascript_builtins_intl_datetimeformat_datetimeformat) as well as server runtimes with support for the `Intl` APIs (such as Node 10+[^1]). When the `Intl` APIs aren't (fully) available, `@sumup/intl` tries to gracefully degrade. Please refer to the [API reference](#api-reference) to learn how certain functions behave when the runtime doesn't support the necessary APIs. If you need to support legacy browsers, consider including [polyfills](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/).

[^1]: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) supports the `Intl` APIs since v8, however, it includes only the English localizations up to v12. Node v13 and above support all locales. If you're unable to use Node v13+, you can either include [polyfills](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/) or use a [custom Node build](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/intl.html#intl_options_for_building_node_js).

## Installation

[`@sumup/intl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/intl) can be installed as a dependency via the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) package managers. Depending on your preference, run one of the following:

```sh
# With npm
npm install @sumup/intl

# With Yarn v1
yarn add @sumup/intl
```

`@sumup/intl` requires Node v10+.

## Usage

The functions exported by `@sumup/intl` share a similar interface such as the common [`locales`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl#locales_argument), [`options`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl#options_argument), and [`currency`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) arguments. These are passed on almost unchanged to the [`Intl.*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl#constructor_properties) constructors and thus support the same values. If the `locales` argument is not provided or is undefined, the runtime's default locale is used. Please refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) for more details.

Each type of data can be formatted with three increasingly advanced functions:

1. The `format*` functions return the formatted value as a string and cover the most common use cases.
2. The `format*ToParts` functions return an array of objects representing the value in parts that can be used for custom locale-aware formatting. For example, part of the formatted value could be rendered in bold.
3. The `resolve*Format` functions return an object with properties reflecting the locale and collation options computed during initialization of the object. These options can be passed to other functions or libraries to format values, for example [`react-number-format`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-number-format).
